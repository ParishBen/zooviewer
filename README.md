# Zooviewer
This gem is directed to the Animal Lovers out there!

Zoos are vital & play a major role in animal conservation efforts globally.

In addition to conservation, Zoos are great facilitators of protecting many endangered species that often have been harmed by poachers or other existential risks & threats. Unfortunately these are often caused by us humans; which makes the preservation & education at Zoos very important!

ABOUT: This gem takes from a solid list of 25 Zoos across America that are certainly worthy of visiting on your next day off or planned vacation.

It scrapes a list composed by VacationIdea.com, published earlier in June 2020. It will display the Zoo of your choice & give you Contact Info & Fun Facts of the respective Zoo. Then you can revisit the list to learn about other great Zoos & exit when you're ready!

    Enjoy your Zoo!!
